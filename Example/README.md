`AHAQ.ios_gamit_bernese_raw.neu` is **not** supported by **TSAnalyzer**. One can use **TSAnalyzer**'s header comments tool to add comments to let this file can be read by **TSAnalyzer**.

`BJFS.neu` is a one column time series file. Because of its comments, it also can be supported by **TSAnalyzer.**

**TSAnalyzer** can read `CAND.sio.noamf_frame.pos` and `CHUM.tseries` directly.

`offsets.json`is the offsets record file.
